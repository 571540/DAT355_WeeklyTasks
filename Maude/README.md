I was not able to fully complete this assignment. I did the modules more or less, except Semantics, since I did not quite understand what to do there. 
I also didn't exactly know how to test the code, or what output I was suppose to expect if I did it right. I did collaborate a bit with Sivert in order to understand 
the language better and how to actually code it since we were in the same boat, but it was still hard. Hopefully, my understanding will improve when I attend the upcomming classes.
